<h3>How to play?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Every player picks a number, and the game will generate a random number from 0 to 20</li>
<li>The closest player to the generated number will attack first</li>
<li>Every player has 20 points of health and each attack is also randomized</li>
<li>If both players picked the same number the game will randomly choose the first attacker</li>
</ul>

<h4>Install</h4>

<ul>
<li>"Lucky.py" is just a Python script, download and run..((Require python))</li>
<li>"Lucky-compiled.pyc" if you didn't install python</li>
</ul>
